# node-watch-lib

## Disclaimer

I did it for learning purpose, and you should consider coding this yourself too.

## Usage

In your project root, use the bin command like this :

```sh
$ yarn watch yourscript.js
```

This will lauch your script, and on change of a file matching `/\.js$/`, this will reload `yourscript.js`.

## Requirements

* Node.js > v0.7.0
* Yarn or Npm, check script cat in package.json for your convenience.
